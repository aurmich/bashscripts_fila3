### Summary
Total Errors Found: 203 (â†‘74 from previous scan)

### Fixed Issues
1. Added Valutatore model and relationship
2. Fixed property access in GetHaDirittoMotivoAction
3. Added proper type hints in HasExcellenceByYearAction
4. Added property checks in MakePdfByRecord

### Remaining Error Categories

1. Undefined Properties Access (Model Properties)
   - `$anno` in GetHaDirittoMotivoAction
   - `$ente`, `$matr` in HasExcellenceByYearAction
   - `$valutatore` in MakePdfByRecord
   - Multiple other model properties

2. Method Return Type Issues
   - `filter()` method in multiple models returning incorrect Builder types
   - Template type covariance issues in models:
     - PerformanceComportamenti
     - PerformanceObiettivi

3. Undefined Methods
   - `OfListaTipoCodice()` in MutatorTrait
   - Called on HasMany relations

### Required Fixes

1. Model Properties
```php
// Add property definitions to models
protected $fillable = [
    'tot',  // Missing in Organizzativa and OrganizzativaCatCoeff models
    // ... other properties
];

// Or use proper property docblocks
/**
 * @property float $tot Total value
 */
```

2. Builder Return Types
```php
/**
 * @param array<string, mixed> $data
 * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder<\Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model>
 */
public function filter(array $data)
{
    // Implementation
}
```

3. Missing Methods
- Either implement `OfListaTipoCodice()` as a scope
- Or create a proper relationship method
